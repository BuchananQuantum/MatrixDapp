# Getting started

Welcome to the Matrix

getMatrix allows you to engage with Web3 appslications know as "Dapp's". Dencentrailizing your social Identity enables users to own their data for the first time in history.
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Google have made astronomical sums of money over the course of the last 20 years by actively reselling your user data to target ad's ona  per-user
basis. Ensuring that "Jon Doe" has relevant ad's in his social feeds based on Jon's most recent searches, youtube histroy, likes on instagram, tags he's associated with his own social
posts. It's rabithole of a never ending business model based on you..
